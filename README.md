Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mohd Sufyan Kamil, a full stack developer with a degree in Computer Engineering. I have a passion for creating clean, efficient code and finding innovative solutions to complex problems.

I have experience working with a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter, Node.js, and MongoDB. I have worked on both front-end and back-end development.. In my current role as a full stack developer at Headstrait Software LLP, I work on designing to ensure consistent user experience and user interface design, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing application and implement a RESTful API to integrate the application with third-party services, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient workflow..

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cricket or listening to music.

Feel free to check out my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on a project or have any questions! ðŸ˜Š
